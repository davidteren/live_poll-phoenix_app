## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Elixir 1.14 or later
- Erlang/OTP 25 or later
- PostgreSQL 14 or later
- Node.js 18 or later (for asset compilation)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd live_poll
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   mix setup
   ```
   This will:
   - Install Elixir dependencies
   - Install Node.js dependencies
   - Create and migrate the database

3. **Start the Phoenix server**
   ```bash
   mix phx.server
   ```
   Or start it inside IEx for interactive development:
   ```bash
   iex -S mix phx.server
   ```

4. **Visit the application**

   Open your browser and navigate to [`http://localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000)

## üìñ Usage

- Zoom in/out on the trend chart using mouse wheel or pinch gestures
- Pan across the chart by clicking and dragging
- Zoom state persists when switching time ranges

### Seeding Data
- Click **Seed Data** to generate 10,000 realistic votes
- Watch the elegant loading modal with animated spinner
- Charts populate with realistic language popularity distribution
- Data reflects 2025 programming language trends

### Resetting

- Switch between light and dark modes
- Theme preference is saved automatically

## üèó Architecture Highlights

### LiveView Components
- **PollLive** - Main LiveView module handling all real-time logic
- **Layouts** - Shared layout components with theme support
- **Core Components** - Reusable UI components (buttons, inputs, etc.)

### Database Schema
- **poll_options** - Stores language names and vote counts
- **vote_events** - Time-series event log with timestamps for trend analysis

### JavaScript Hooks
- **PieChart** - ECharts integration for pie chart visualization
- **TrendChart** - ECharts integration for trend line chart with zoom persistence
- **ThemeToggle** - Theme switching with localStorage persistence

### Real-time Features
- **Phoenix PubSub** broadcasts vote events to all connected clients
- **LiveView** automatically updates the DOM when state changes
- **push_event** sends chart data updates to JavaScript hooks
