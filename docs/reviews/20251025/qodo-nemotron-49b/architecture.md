# Architecture & Design Patterns Analysis

## Application Structure
The LivePoll application follows a typical Phoenix project structure with the following key components:

1. **LiveView Components**: `PollLive` handles the main real-time dashboard
2. **Ecto Schemas**: `Option` and `VoteEvent` schemas manage data storage
3. **PubSub Integration**: Uses Phoenix.PubSub for real-time updates
4. **Time-Series Data**: `VoteEvent` table tracks voting history
5. **Chart Integration**: ECharts visualization via JS hooks

## Data Flow
1. **User Interaction**:
   - Vote button clicks trigger `vote` event
   - Events handled by `PollLive` which updates the database
   - Database changes broadcast via PubSub
   - All connected clients receive updates and re-render

2. **Real-Time Updates**:
   - Phoenix LiveView streams updates to clients
   - Trend data recalculated at intervals
   - Charts updated via Phoenix.LiveView.JS

## Design Patterns
1. **LiveView Streams**: Used for both poll updates and trend data
2. **Event Sourcing**: Vote events stored for historical analysis
3. **CQRS Pattern**: Separate read models for trend analysis
4. **Time Bucketing**: Trend data aggregated into time intervals

## Key Components
1. **PollLive**
   - Handles mounting, event handling, and data assignment
   - Manages seeding process and statistics
   - Broadcasts updates via PubSub

2. **VoteEvent Schema**
   - Stores timestamped voting records
   - Used for trend analysis and historical data

3. **Trend Calculation**
   - Dynamic time window support (5m, 1h, 12h, 24h)
   - Bucket-based aggregation for performance

## Recommendations
1. **Context Modules**: Extract data access into separate contexts
2. **Background Jobs**: Use Oban or other job queues for seeding
3. **Materialized Views**: For frequently accessed trend data
4. **LiveComponent**: Break down UI into reusable components
5. **Caching Layer**: Add caching for trend data and statistics
