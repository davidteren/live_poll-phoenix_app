# Code Review Findings for LivePoll Application

## Overview
The LivePoll application follows Phoenix best practices with a clean structure but exhibits some areas for improvement in code organization and maintainability.

## Key Observations
1. **LiveView Complexity**
   - The `PollLive` module contains extensive business logic directly in the LiveView component, violating separation of concerns.
   - The `mount/3` function performs multiple responsibilities including data loading, trend calculation, and timer setup.
   - Example: The seeding process (300+ lines) is embedded within the LiveView handler.

2. **Ecto Usage**
   - Direct use of `Repo.get!/2` and `Repo.update!/2` in LiveView handlers
   - Example: `option = Repo.get!(Option, id)` in `handle_event("vote",...)`
   - Recommendation: Move data access to a context module

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - The `build_trend_data_from_events/1` function performs complex database queries and transformations in the LiveView
   - Example: `from(e in VoteEvent, where:..., order_by: [asc: e.inserted_at], preload: :option)`
   - Recommendation: Consider materialized views or background jobs for trend calculations

4. **Security**
   - Direct HTML rendering in `poll_live.html.heex` uses `Jason.encode!/1` for dynamic attributes
   - Example: `data-trend-data={Jason.encode!(@trend_data)}`
   - Recommendation: Ensure proper escaping of dynamic content

5. **Code Organization**
   - The `poll_live.html.heex` template contains complex logic for chart rendering
   - Example: The `trend_line_points/2` function generates SVG paths directly in the view
   - Recommendation: Extract chart rendering to separate components

## Recommendations
- Create separate contexts for poll management and voting
- Move data access and business logic out of LiveView
- Implement background workers for data seeding and trend calculations
- Extract chart components into reusable LiveComponents
- Add input validation and error handling for user-generated content
