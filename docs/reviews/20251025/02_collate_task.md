I need you to create a comprehensive, collated analysis by consolidating multiple AI-generated code reviews.

## Context
- Base directory: `docs/reviews/20251025/`
- This directory contains multiple subdirectories, each with AI-generated analysis files
- The tasks being analyzed are defined in: `wip/TASK.md`
- Each subdirectory contains 7 analysis documents

## Your Tasks

### 1. Create Collated Documentation
In the `docs/reviews/20251025/collated/` directory, create a single authoritative set of 7 analysis documents.

**Base these documents on:**
- Primary source: The 7 files from `docs/reviews/20251025/qodo-claude-41-opus/`
- Use these as the foundation/template for the collated versions

### 2. Validate and Update with Current Best Practices
For each of the 7 collated documents:
- Search the web for the latest versions of any mentioned dependencies, frameworks, or libraries
- Verify that all recommended approaches align with current best practices (as of 2025)
- Update any outdated information, deprecated APIs, or superseded patterns
- Ensure version numbers, configuration examples, and code samples reflect current standards

### 3. Integrate Insights from Other Reviews
- Review ALL other subdirectories in `docs/reviews/20251025/` (excluding `qodo-claude-41-opus` and `collated`)
- For each subdirectory's analysis files:
    - Identify unique insights, recommendations, or perspectives not present in the base documents
    - Evaluate whether these insights add value
    - Integrate valuable missing insights into the appropriate collated documents
    - Maintain coherence and avoid redundancy

## Deliverables
- 7 comprehensive, up-to-date analysis documents in `docs/reviews/20251025/collated/`
- Each document should be the definitive version combining the best insights from all reviews
- All information should be current and reflect 2025 best practices
