# Summary & Recommendations

## Executive Summary
The LivePoll app is a well-structured Phoenix LiveView demo with real-time voting and charts. Strengths include clean code, effective PubSub usage, and modern features. Weaknesses: Performance issues in seeding/trends, partial test coverage, minor security gaps, and some guideline violations (e.g., form handling). Dependencies mostly current, but ECharts version mismatch. DaisyUI vendored but minimally used.

## Prioritized Issues
- **Critical**: None.
- **High**: Seeding inefficiency (10k individual inserts), trend query loading all events.
- **Medium**: Untested features (seeding, trends), raw forms instead of components.
- **Low**: Vendored DaisyUI, minor validation gaps.

## Actionable Recommendations
- Optimize seeding with batch inserts.
- Extract trend logic to DB aggregations.
- Add tests for untested paths.
- Use Phoenix components for forms.
- Update ECharts to ^5.5.1.
- Remove or properly depend on DaisyUI.

## Roadmap for Technical Debt
1. Short-term: Fix perf bottlenecks, add tests.
2. Medium-term: Refactor to contexts, improve security.
3. Long-term: Add auth, scalability features.
