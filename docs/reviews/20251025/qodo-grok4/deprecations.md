# Deprecated Code & Dependencies Analysis

## Deprecated Phoenix, Ecto, or Elixir Functions/Patterns
- No instances of deprecated functions like `live_redirect` or `live_patch` were found. The code uses modern alternatives such as `push_event` and direct LiveView routing.
- In the template `lib/live_poll_web/live/poll_live.html.heex`, raw HTML `<form>` and `<input>` tags are used instead of the recommended Phoenix.Component functions like `<.form>` and `<.input>`. This is not strictly deprecated but violates best practices as per Phoenix guidelines (lines 424-432 in poll_live.html.heex).
- No other deprecated patterns identified in the reviewed code.

## Outdated LiveView Patterns
- The LiveView implementation in `lib/live_poll_web/live/poll_live.ex` uses modern stream patterns and PubSub for real-time updates, which is current.
- However, form handling uses raw `<form phx-submit>` instead of `to_form/2` and `<.form>`, which is an outdated approach (line 424 in poll_live.html.heex).

## Outdated Dependencies in mix.exs
- All Elixir dependencies appear up-to-date based on latest versions:
  - phoenix ~> 1.8.1 (latest: 1.8.1)
  - phoenix_live_view ~> 1.1.0 (latest: 1.1.16, constraint allows updates)
  - ecto_sql ~> 3.13 (latest: 3.13.2)
  - Other deps like postgrex, phoenix_html, etc., are at current versions.
- No security vulnerabilities noted in Elixir deps.

## Outdated npm Packages in assets/package.json
- echarts ^6.0.0: The latest released version is 5.5.1 (as of October 2024). Specifying ^6.0.0 may prevent installation or point to a non-existent version. Recommendation: Downgrade to ^5.5.1.
- No other npm dependencies listed.

## DaisyUI Usage
- DaisyUI is referenced in vendor files (assets/vendor/daisyui.js and daisyui-theme.js) and in comments in core_components.ex (line 12).
- It's imported in app.css (lines 15-26) as a Tailwind plugin.
- Given the minimal custom UI components and reliance on Tailwind, DaisyUI may not be necessary. The app could achieve similar styling with pure Tailwind, reducing bundle size. However, if specific DaisyUI components are used (none explicitly found in templates), it might be justified.
- No direct dependency in package.json; appears to be vendored.

## Security Vulnerabilities
- No known security issues in the listed dependencies based on quick checks.
- Recommend running `mix deps.audit` for Elixir and `npm audit` for npm to confirm.

Overall, the codebase is mostly modern, with minor issues in form handling and the ECharts version specification.
