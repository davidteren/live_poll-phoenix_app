# Polls Context Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Successfully extracted business logic from the monolithic 718-line `PollLive` module into a proper Phoenix context pattern, reducing the LiveView to 349 lines (51% reduction) and making the codebase more maintainable and testable.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Polls Context Module
**File:** `lib/live_poll/polls.ex` (370 lines)

The main context module provides a clean public API for all poll-related operations:

#### Options Management
- `list_options/0` - Get all options sorted by ID
- `list_options_by_votes/0` - Get options sorted by votes (descending)
- `get_option!/1` - Get single option (raises if not found)
- `get_option/1` - Get single option (returns nil if not found)
- `get_option_by_text/1` - Find option by language name
- `add_language/1` - Add new language with validation
- `delete_option/1` - Delete an option

#### Voting Operations
- `cast_vote/1` - Atomic vote increment with event recording
- `reset_all_votes/0` - Reset all votes and clear history

#### Statistics & Calculations
- `calculate_percentages/1` - Calculate vote percentages
- `get_total_votes/0` - Sum of all votes
- `get_stats/0` - Comprehensive statistics (options, totals, percentages, leader)

#### Vote Events & History
- `list_vote_events/1` - Query vote events with filters (option_id, since, limit, event_type)

#### Trends & Time Series
- `calculate_trends/1` - Calculate voting trends over time

#### Seeding
- `seed_votes/1` - Generate realistic test data

#### PubSub Broadcasting
- Internal functions for broadcasting updates to all connected clients
- `broadcast_data_seeded/0` - Public function for seeding completion

### 2. Created VoteService Module
**File:** `lib/live_poll/polls/vote_service.ex` (67 lines)

Handles voting calculations:
- `calculate_percentages/1` - Calculate vote percentages for options
- `percentage/2` - Calculate single percentage

### 3. Created TrendAnalyzer Module
**File:** `lib/live_poll/polls/trend_analyzer.ex` (207 lines)

Handles complex time-series analysis:
- `calculate/1` - Main trend calculation function
- Dynamic bucket sizing based on time range (5min, 1hr, 12hr, 24hr)
- State carry-forward for missing buckets
- Efficient database aggregation
- Percentage distribution over time

**Key Features:**
- 5 minutes: 5-second buckets, 60 snapshots
- 1 hour: 30-second buckets, 120 snapshots
- 12 hours: 5-minute buckets, 144 snapshots
- 24 hours: 10-minute buckets, 144 snapshots

### 4. Created Seeder Module
**File:** `lib/live_poll/polls/seeder.ex` (223 lines)

Handles realistic data seeding:
- `seed/1` - Main seeding function with options
- Weighted language selection based on 2025 popularity trends
- Random timestamp backfilling
- Configurable parameters (num_languages, total_votes, hours_back)

**Default Behavior:**
- Selects 12-14 random languages
- Generates ~10,000 total votes
- Backfills 1 hour of history
- Uses realistic popularity weights (Python: 100, JavaScript: 85, TypeScript: 70, etc.)

### 5. Refactored PollLive Module
**File:** `lib/live_poll_web/live/poll_live.ex` (349 lines, down from 718)

**Removed:**
- All direct `Repo` calls
- All database queries
- Complex business logic (169 lines of seeding code)
- Trend calculation logic (144 lines)
- Vote event management

**Kept:**
- UI event handlers
- PubSub subscription and message handling
- Real-time update logic
- Chart rendering helpers (pie_slice_path, trend_line_points)
- UI-specific helpers (language_to_class)

**Added:**
- `load_poll_data/1` - Helper to load data from context
- Simplified event handlers using context functions

### 6. Created Comprehensive Tests
**File:** `test/live_poll/polls_test.exs` (300 lines)

Test coverage for:
- ✅ Options management (list, get, add, delete)
- ✅ Voting operations (cast_vote, reset)
- ✅ Concurrent vote handling
- ✅ Statistics calculations
- ✅ Vote event queries with filters
- ✅ Edge cases (empty data, invalid inputs)

## Benefits

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- **Before:** Everything in LiveView (UI + business logic + database)
- **After:** Clear separation (Context for business logic, LiveView for UI)

### 2. Testability
- **Before:** Cannot test business logic without LiveView
- **After:** Can test all business logic in isolation

### 3. Reusability
- **Before:** Logic locked in LiveView
- **After:** Context functions can be used anywhere (API, CLI, other LiveViews)

### 4. Maintainability
- **Before:** 718-line monolithic file
- **After:** 4 focused modules with clear responsibilities

### 5. Performance
- **Before:** Heavy computations block LiveView process
- **After:** Can easily move heavy operations to background tasks

### 6. Code Quality
- **Before:** Mixed concerns, hard to understand
- **After:** Well-documented, follows Phoenix conventions

## Testing Instructions

### Run All Context Tests
```bash
mix test test/live_poll/polls_test.exs
```

### Run Specific Test Groups
```bash
# Test voting operations
mix test test/live_poll/polls_test.exs --only voting

# Test statistics
mix test test/live_poll/polls_test.exs --only stats
```

### Run All Tests
```bash
mix test
```

### Check Code Quality
```bash
# Format code
mix format

# Run static analysis
mix credo

# Check for compilation warnings
mix compile --warnings-as-errors
```

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Polls context module created with all business logic

## Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes
**None** - This is a pure refactoring. All existing functionality is preserved.

### API Changes
The LiveView public API remains unchanged. All changes are internal.

### Database Changes

## Lines of Code Summary

| Module | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| PollLive | 718 | 349 | -369 (-51%) |
| Polls Context | 0 | 370 | +370 |
| VoteService | 0 | 67 | +67 |
| TrendAnalyzer | 0 | 207 | +207 |
| Seeder | 0 | 223 | +223 |
| Tests | 0 | 300 | +300 |
| **Total** | **718** | **1,516** | **+798** |

**Note:** While total lines increased, this is expected and beneficial:
- Code is now properly organized and documented
- Business logic is testable in isolation
- Each module has a single, clear responsibility
- LiveView is focused solely on UI concerns

## Conclusion

This refactoring successfully transforms a monolithic LiveView into a well-structured Phoenix application following best practices. The business logic is now:
- ✅ Testable in isolation
- ✅ Reusable across the application
- ✅ Well-documented
- ✅ Following Phoenix conventions
- ✅ Easier to maintain and extend

The LiveView is now focused on what it should be: handling UI events and real-time updates.
