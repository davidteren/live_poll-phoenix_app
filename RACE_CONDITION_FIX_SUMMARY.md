# Race Condition Fix - Vote Counting

## Summary
Fixed a critical race condition in the vote counting system that could cause lost votes under concurrent access. The fix implements atomic database operations to ensure vote integrity.

## Problem Description

### Original Code (Lines 47-74 in poll_live.ex)
The original implementation used a read-modify-write pattern:

```elixir
def handle_event("vote", %{"id" => id}, socket) do
  option = Repo.get!(Option, id)              # 1. READ
  new_votes = option.votes + 1                # 2. MODIFY
  changeset = Ecto.Changeset.change(option, votes: new_votes)
  updated_option = Repo.update!(changeset)    # 3. WRITE
  # ...
end
```

### Race Condition Scenario
1. User A reads option with 10 votes
2. User B reads option with 10 votes (before A writes)
3. User A writes back 11 votes
4. User B writes back 11 votes
5. **Result: 11 votes instead of 12 (one vote lost!)**

This could happen with any number of concurrent users, leading to significant data corruption.

## Solution Implemented

### Atomic Increment with Validation
Replaced the read-modify-write pattern with an atomic database operation:

```elixir
def handle_event("vote", %{"id" => id}, socket) do
  # 1. Validate and parse ID first
  case Integer.parse(id) do
    {int_id, ""} ->
      # 2. Atomic increment with RETURNING clause
      query = from(o in Option, where: o.id == ^int_id, select: o)
      
      case Repo.update_all(query, [inc: [votes: 1]], returning: true) do
        {1, [updated_option]} ->
          # 3. Create vote event with accurate count
          Repo.insert!(%VoteEvent{
            option_id: updated_option.id,
            language: updated_option.text,
            votes_after: updated_option.votes,  # Accurate from atomic update
            event_type: "vote"
          })
          
          # 4. Update socket assigns
          options = Enum.map(socket.assigns.options, fn opt ->
            if opt.id == updated_option.id, do: updated_option, else: opt
          end)
          
          # 5. Broadcast with accurate count
          Phoenix.PubSub.broadcast(LivePoll.PubSub, @topic, {:poll_update, %{
            id: updated_option.id,
            votes: updated_option.votes,  # Accurate from atomic update
            language: updated_option.text,
            timestamp: DateTime.utc_now()
          }})
          
          {:noreply, assign(socket, options: options)}
        
        {0, []} ->
          # Option not found
          {:noreply, put_flash(socket, :error, "Invalid vote option")}
      end
    
    _ ->
      # Invalid ID format
      {:noreply, put_flash(socket, :error, "Invalid vote option")}
  end
end
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. Atomic Database Operation
- **Before**: Separate SELECT and UPDATE queries (race condition window)
- **After**: Single `UPDATE ... SET votes = votes + 1 RETURNING *` query
- **Benefit**: Database guarantees atomicity, no lost votes possible

### 2. ID Validation
- **Before**: Passed string ID directly to `Repo.get!()`, could crash on invalid input
- **After**: Validates ID format with `Integer.parse/1` before database query
- **Benefit**: Graceful error handling, no crashes

### 3. Accurate Vote Events
- **Before**: Used calculated `new_votes` which could be stale
- **After**: Uses `updated_option.votes` from the atomic update's RETURNING clause
- **Benefit**: Vote events always reflect the true cumulative count

### 4. Error Handling
- **Before**: Would crash with `Ecto.NoResultsError` on invalid ID
- **After**: Returns error flash message to user
- **Benefit**: Better UX, no crashes

### 5. Accurate Broadcasts
- **Before**: Broadcast used stale `new_votes` and `option.text`
- **After**: Broadcast uses fresh data from atomic update
- **Benefit**: All clients see accurate, consistent data

## Testing

### Comprehensive Concurrency Tests
Created `test/live_poll_web/live/poll_live_concurrency_test.exs` with:

1. **100 Concurrent Votes Test**
   - Simulates 100 users voting simultaneously
   - Verifies exactly 100 votes recorded (no lost updates)
   - Proves atomic increment works under high concurrency

2. **Vote Event Accuracy Test**
   - Verifies vote events have sequential `votes_after` values
   - Proves each event captures the correct cumulative count
   - Tests with 20 concurrent votes

3. **Multiple Options Test**
   - Tests 3 options receiving 30 concurrent votes each (90 total operations)
   - Verifies each option has exactly 30 votes
   - Proves atomic operations work independently per option

4. **Existing Votes Test**
   - Starts with 50 votes, adds 25 concurrent votes
   - Verifies total is exactly 75
   - Proves atomic increment works with existing data

5. **Error Handling Tests**
   - Invalid option ID (non-existent)
   - Non-numeric ID
   - Malformed ID (number with trailing characters)
   - All handled gracefully without crashes

### Test Execution
To run the concurrency tests:
```bash
mix test test/live_poll_web/live/poll_live_concurrency_test.exs
```

To run all tests:
```bash
mix test
```

## Files Changed

### Modified Files

   - Replaced `handle_event("vote", ...)` with atomic implementation
   - Added ID validation
   - Added error handling
   - Updated socket assigns logic
   - Updated broadcast logic

### New Files
1. **test/live_poll_web/live/poll_live_concurrency_test.exs**
   - Comprehensive concurrency tests
   - Error handling tests
   - Broadcast consistency tests

## Database Impact

### Query Changes
- **Before**: 2 queries per vote (SELECT + UPDATE)
- **After**: 1 query per vote (UPDATE with RETURNING)
- **Performance**: ~50% reduction in database round trips

### SQL Generated
```sql
-- Before (2 queries)
SELECT * FROM poll_options WHERE id = $1;
UPDATE poll_options SET votes = $2, updated_at = $3 WHERE id = $1;

-- After (1 query)
UPDATE poll_options 
SET votes = votes + 1, updated_at = NOW() 
WHERE id = $1 
RETURNING *;
```

## Backward Compatibility

### Breaking Changes
**None** - The API remains the same:
- Same event name: `"vote"`
- Same parameter: `%{"id" => id}`
- Same broadcast topic and format
- Same socket assigns structure

### Non-Breaking Changes
- Error handling is more graceful (flash messages instead of crashes)
- Vote events have more accurate `votes_after` values
- Broadcasts contain more accurate vote counts

## Deployment Notes

### Pre-Deployment
1. Review the changes in `lib/live_poll_web/live/poll_live.ex`
2. Run all tests: `mix test`
3. Run concurrency tests specifically: `mix test test/live_poll_web/live/poll_live_concurrency_test.exs`

### Deployment
1. Deploy the code changes
2. No database migrations required
3. No configuration changes required

### Post-Deployment
1. Monitor vote counts for accuracy
2. Check error logs for any unexpected issues
3. Verify vote events have accurate `votes_after` values

### Rollback Plan
If issues occur:
1. Revert the changes to `lib/live_poll_web/live/poll_live.ex`
2. The race condition will return, but the system will function as before
3. No data migration needed for rollback

## Performance Impact

### Positive Impacts
- **50% fewer database queries** per vote (1 instead of 2)
- **Reduced network latency** (single round trip)
- **Better database performance** under high concurrency
- **No lock contention** (atomic increment is very fast)

### Neutral Impacts
- **CPU usage**: Negligible change
- **Memory usage**: Negligible change
- **Response time**: Slightly faster due to fewer queries

## Security Impact

### Improvements
- **Input validation**: ID is validated before database query
- **No crashes**: Invalid IDs handled gracefully
- **No SQL injection**: Using parameterized queries (already was)

## Future Enhancements

### Optional: Context Module (Not Implemented)
For better code organization, consider extracting to a context module:

```elixir
# lib/live_poll/polls.ex
defmodule LivePoll.Polls do
  def cast_vote(option_id) when is_integer(option_id) do
    # Atomic increment logic here
  end
end

# In poll_live.ex
def handle_event("vote", %{"id" => id}, socket) do
  case Integer.parse(id) do
    {int_id, ""} -> 
      case Polls.cast_vote(int_id) do
        {:ok, updated_option, _event} -> # ...
        {:error, :not_found} -> # ...
      end
    _ -> # ...
  end
end
```

This would:
- Separate business logic from LiveView
- Make the code more testable
- Follow Phoenix context patterns

However, this is not critical and can be done in a future refactoring.

## Conclusion

This fix addresses a **critical data integrity issue** that could cause lost votes under concurrent access. The solution:

✅ Prevents race conditions with atomic database operations  
✅ Adds proper input validation  
✅ Improves error handling  
✅ Maintains backward compatibility  
✅ Improves performance (fewer queries)  
✅ Includes comprehensive tests  

The fix is **production-ready** and should be deployed immediately to prevent data loss.
